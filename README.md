This is a solution to the Article preview component challenge(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

  - Frontend Mentor | Article preview component challenge
  - The challenge consisted in replicating social proof section card component for a desktop and mobile view perspective. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. See the social media share links when they click the share icon.
  - Here it is two screenshots taken from desktop and mobile perspective;

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS + Javascript  - I am not 100% satisfied with the result of this challenge, but, in overall, I think it is ok. I couldn't figure out how to change the color of the svg arrow icon. The layout is fine, I guess. Of course, It needs to be improved, especially in the transitions of the share button, but It was a good opportunity to practice the positioning and creating some kind of arrow (I never did something like it before). Also, the ul li tags was also tricky to make it work. The Javascript part was also challenging. First, I tried to change the opacity and the visibility attributes directly of the element, but I couldn't. So, I had to work on its parent element and change the display instead. I could pull this off, but It took me some hours.. The mobile version is ok, but again, I don't know how to change the inside color of the icon, so I got a little frustrated with that.
